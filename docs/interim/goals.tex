\section{Project Goals}

\subsection{Model fitting}

The primary goal of the project is to produce an application that can process voxel data of a walking figure and generate a simple 3D skeletal model.
In its simplest form the model will consist of four cylinders representing the thighs and lower legs.
The angles these cylinders make with each other and the hips will be measured and stored to be used as part of the figure's identifying information.

The application should also able to track the movement of the parts of the model over subsequent frames of a video.
It should take advantage of the temporal continuity of human gait - that the change in position of a certain point on a person's torso between frames is quite small.
This can be used to simplify model-fitting across multiple frames -
the position of the model in the last frame can be used as a starting point and can narrow down the possible model positions of subsequent frames.


\subsection{Real-time}

One of the most interesting aspects of gait-recognition is its applicability to security, and the advantages of being able to identify people from a distance without their knowledge.
For gait systems to be of use in real-world environments they should make use of efficient image-analysis techniques and be able to identify people quickly.
A system should be able to raise an alert as soon as possible after a target figure moves into the surveilence area, and not be dependent on slow image-processing implementations.

While it might not be possible to make this process truly real-time, it is one of the goals of this project to investigate ways to improve the performance of gait and its ability to produce results more quickly.


\subsection{Gait recognition}

The target application area of the model-fitting in this project is to gait recognition.

Produce a low-dimensional data-set from the model containing information that may be used to uniquely identify the person.

\subsection{More joints}

Investigate any benefit gained from including other joints in the skeletal model.
