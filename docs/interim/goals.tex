\section{Project Goals}

\subsection{Model fitting}

The primary goal of the project is to produce an application that can process voxel data of a walking and generate a simple 3D skeletal model.
In its simplest form the model will consist of a pair of thighs and a pair of 

Create an application that processes voxel data of a walking figure, and generates a simple 3D skeletal model.
This model should feature at least the most basic joints (ankle, knee, hip),
with the angles between the limbs being derived from the data.

\subsection{Real-time}

Investigate ways to make the process above real-time,
or as close to real-time as is possible while analysing the motion of points over several frames.

\subsection{Gait recognition}

Produce a low-dimensional data-set from the model containing information that may be used to uniquely identify the person.

\subsection{More joints}

Investigate any benefit gained from including other joints in the skeletal model.
