\section{Background and report of literature search}

\subsection{2D gait recognition}

How has it been done in the past?

\subsection{Non-modelfitting ways}

\subsection{How modelfitting can be applied to gait}

Cadence and stride length \cite{GaitBook}

\subsection{Fitting a model using active contours}

From paper \cite{ImageSegModesl}
Active Shape Models  Proposed by 78, 79
Set of points defined at various features in the image.

A shape Y can be defined by Y(model) + (matrix of eigenvectors)(vector of weights)
Limits on the value of these weights

So what i'd need to do to train model:
For every frame in the video:
  normalize the position and scale
  mark on points of key features
Calculate covariance matrix
PCA to get first eignvalues of covariance matrix

Criticism:
Seems very generic.

\subsection{GPU Processing}

Talk about standard Cg and then CUDA

Any use by gait in the past?
