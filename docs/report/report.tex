\begin{abstract}
	This report describes the progress made into developing a 3D model-fitting application.
	The techniques of filter correlation and active contours are explored in detail, and their use in fitting a model to a reconstructed 3D image is examined.
	Stream-processor implementations are considered as a means of improving the performance of the algorithms.
	Preliminary results have been obtained from these methods, but there is much room for improvement.
	An extension to the filter correlation method is proposed that aims to resolve some of the problems observed during development.
