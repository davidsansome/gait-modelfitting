A new snake-like force functional combining edge-based and region-based forces produces capability for both range and ac-curacy. Properties analogous to surface tension and adhesion are also applied so that the smoothness of the evolving contour and the ability to flow into nar-row branches can be controlled. The method has been assessed on synthetic and natural images, and shows encouraging detection performance and ability to handle noise, consistent with properties included in its formulation."

Hierarchies of shape and motion yield relatively modest computational demands, while anatomical data is used to generate shape models consistent with normal human body proportions. Mean gait data is used to create prototype gait motion models, which are adapted to fit individual subjects. Our approach is evaluated on a large gait database, comprising 4824 sequences from 115 subjects, demonstrating gait extraction and description capability in laboratory and real-world capture conditions. Recognition capability is illustrated by an 84% CCR in laboratory conditions, which is reduced for real-world (outdoor) data. Preliminary results from a statistical analysis of the extracted gait parameters, suggest that recognition capability is primarily gained from cadence and from static shape parameters, although gait is the cue by which these are derived.",
