A new snake-like force functional combining edge-based and region-based forces produces capability for both range and ac-curacy. Properties analogous to surface tension and adhesion are also applied so that the smoothness of the evolving contour and the ability to flow into nar-row branches can be controlled. The method has been assessed on synthetic and natural images, and shows encouraging detection performance and ability to handle noise, consistent with properties included in its formulation."
